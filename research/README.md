## Absorb Ratio

By using PCA, absorb ratio provide a good way to measure the crowdness of a industry

## Financial Risk Ratio

Theoretically, the fundmental indicator of the companies in the same industry should obey the norm distribution. Once deviated, we can assume it implies there are some problems in the company to some extent.

## IndustrialMomentumAndReverse

Different from the traditional momentum indicator, we dissemble the close-to-close momentum to close-to-open and open-to-close. Furthur more, we dissemble the open-to-close momentum to five-minute log return, and filter the extreme part and normal part, constructing factor individually.

## SwQuandrant

Using the relatively strong and weak indicator, calculate the first derivative and the second derivative. Under the assumption that the relatively strong and weak indicator follow a sine curve pattern, we made some predictions and analysis.

## Wurgler & Baker 2006

Calculate the sentiment index by six factors using PCA method, then test the factor performance over different types of firms identified by financial indicators. We reproduced the result.
