# BearAlpha Examples

Here we provide you three examples to use bearalpha in quantative financial. First is [Financial Research](./research/README.md), which is the very first step in digging into a topic. When you find something interesting in financial market, you can just pause and ponder, do some literature research. Then it comes to [Factor Analysis](./factor/README.md), which is the pre-step of making a useful indicator or develop a useful strategy. Finanlly, we run [Event Based Test](./backtest/README.md) to simulate the market as much as we can, just to figure out to what extend the indicator or strategy we develop may be useful.
